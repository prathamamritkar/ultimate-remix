## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

Ultimate REMIX is a client-side web application with the following security considerations:

#### 🔍 What We Protect Against
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Code Injection**: Secure coding practices
- **Data Integrity**: Client-side data validation
- **Privacy**: No collection of personal information

#### ⚠️ Known Limitations
- **Client-Side Nature**: All game logic runs in the browser
- **Local Storage**: Game data stored locally on user's device
- **No Server Validation**: Scores and progress are client-side only

### 📱 Browser Security

The game relies on browser security features:
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented where applicable
- **HTTPS**: Recommended for production deployments
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Leveraged for security
- **Secure Contexts**: Required for some features (audio, etc.)

### 🔐 Data Handling

- **No Personal Data**: Game doesn't collect or store personal information
- **Local Storage**: Only game state and preferences stored locally
- **No Network Transmission**: Game data stays on the user's device
- **Educational Content**: All educational content is static and safe

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope for security reports:

- **Performance Issues**: Unless they enable DoS attacks
- **Game Balance**: Scoring, difficulty, or gameplay balance issues
- **Browser Compatibility**: Unless it creates security vulnerabilities
- **Third-Party Services**: Issues with Farcade SDK or other external services
- **Social Engineering**: Issues requiring user to take unsafe actions

## 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make Ultimate REMIX safer:

- **Acknowledgment**: With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution
